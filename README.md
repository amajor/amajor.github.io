## About

Alison began her career as a graphic designer and moved into web development and writing custom scripts. She later helped to design and develop a web application for an online web-to-print system.

Alison was asked to join the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team upon its inception at her workplace in January 2018 and worked with business stakeholders to research, design, develop, test, and deploy process automations in vital business areas.

In May 2019, Alison was promoted to Senior Developer and led a development pod that was largely responsible for the creation and centralization of one of the company's most popular and successful internal bots which creates and submits orders by reading purchase orders via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

In her current professional role, Alison helps lead the technical development and management of RPA bots as a Technical Delivery Lead.
 
Alison has been married to her husband Chris since 2007 and lives in West Michigan with their two kids. When she’s not working, Alison enjoys sailing with her family on their boat named Fika, learning new things (she’s currently taking graduate classes for a Master's in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering), and curling up with a good fantasy or adventure story with a nice cup of tea.
