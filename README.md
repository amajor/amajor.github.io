# Alison Major

## Developer, Instructor, Kid Sherpa

Getting her start as a graphic designer, Alison began her career in the print industry, bringing information to life on paper with color, photos, and layouts. When she moved into the technology scene, she found her groove in programming and has been honing her craft ever since.

As an application developer, Alison shines in front end development and spends much of her efforts working towards a positive user experience. Instead of ink on a page, she slings hex codes, tests, components, and responsive layouts to make the digital world a more beautiful place.

Alison also teaches a course in "Intro to Programming" that gives foundational programming skills through Javascript examples, as well as introducing students to necessary soft skills through developing an application over the semester through project planning, user stories, test driven development, and more.

She resides in Holland, MI with her husband Chris, two kids, dog, and two cats. In her free time she loves to make jams and jellies or bake breads and goodies.
